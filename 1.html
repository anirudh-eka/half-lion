        <p>Where to begin with <em>Hiranyakaship</em>? Where does any story begin? I could start with before he was Hiranyakaship, when he was the gatekeeper for <em>Vishnu</em>, when he got cursed in the first place. But then, what led him to make that mistake? There’s just too many beginnings to choose from. So I guess, I’ll start in the middle, like everyone else does, with absolutely no fucking context (NFC).</p> 
        <p>One day King Hiranyakaship was performing <em>tapas</em> to Brahma (or Shiva, can't remember). What the tapas actually entailed I’ll get into later. For now, just know he worked really really hard. So hard that Brahma finally showed up (unlike my dad) to grant him a wish.</p>
        <p>Hiranyakaship first asked for immortality, but Brahma refused. All things that have a beginning, must have an end. So he tried something clever. He wished that he <em>could</em> be killed </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Neither by human, nor by animal</li>
          <li>Neither inside, nor outside his home</li>
          <li>Neither on land, nor in the sky</li>
          <li>Neither at day, nor at night</li>
          <li>Etc, etc.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>A technique, we call blacklisting in software. Brahma accepted.</p>
        <p>Feeling like he covered all possible causes of death, Hiranyakaship proclaimed himself supreme God and required all of his subjects to only worship him. Everybody in the kingdom complied, except for one, his own son, Prahalad (me!).</p>
        <p>Hiranyakaship was <em>pissed</em>. How could his own son disobey him?! Leave alone, follow a God that no one can see! Legend has it, he tried to brutally punish and even kill Prahalad many times. He tried poisoning him, drowning him, trampling him with elephants, and even burning him. Each time Prahalad was saved by the other god. Typically when the story is told, that god is Vishnu, but it really doesn’t matter what the name is.</p>
        <p>Finally, a frustrated Hiranyakaship asks his son to show him this other god. Pointing to a pillar in the palace, he asks, “is your god in that pillar?” Prahalad tells his father that God is in everything, even the pillar. Hiranyakaship smashed the pillar with his mace. From the clearing dust, emerged Vishnu in the form of Narasimha, a creature that was half human and half lion. Narasimha kills Hiranyakaship</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Neither inside, nor outside his home, but on his door frame</li>
          <li>Neither at day, nor at night, but at twilight</li>
          <li>Neither on land, nor in the sky, but on his lap</li>
        </ol>
        <p>And if you didn’t catch it, being half-lion, Narasimha was neither (entirely) human, nor animal. So, intersectionality for the win! (Though I prefer the term compositionality.) This is my story as it’s usually told. I guess it’s not wrong. It’s mythology after all. And what is manhood if not mythology?</p>
