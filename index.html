        <p>The Holy Father had this annoying habit of mansplaining. I blame my mom for it. She looked to him for answers on everything. He even explained to us what we were feeling, which always felt like a contradiction. How could an all knowing being ever really know what it's like to not know? But I guess, if he didnâ€™t know what itâ€™s like to be us, he wouldnâ€™t technically be all knowing. ðŸ¤”</p> 
        <p>Anyway, thatâ€™s divine logic (and itâ€™s not genetic). He used it when he coded to make our computer seem like a thinking being. And here he was, once again, hoping to program a little intelligence into me, even if it was just artificial too.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, I could not recognize the letters he had written on the whiteboard. It wasnâ€™t always a problem, but this was one of the times it would be. I could feel his jaw clench under his mane, the air calcifying in the room, blood pushing through my jugular. I snatched a single glance at his golden eyes before his fist crashed full force onto my face. My body staggered back as tears bled onto the carpet. The ring in my ear subsided enough for me to hear him snarl his question again.</p>
        <p>My cousins could speak Telugu fluently and I couldnâ€™t even piece together a fucking sentence. I knew I was incompetent, but couldnâ€™t he at least see I was trying? Wasnâ€™t this the blindest faith? To follow Godâ€™s word even when you couldnâ€™t follow his letters?</p>
        <p>When people tell my story, they tell it as though I decided one day to disobey my dad on purpose. The truth is, when I first began disobeying him it wasnâ€™t even something I did. I was just me being my incompetent self. I was my first act of disobedience.</p>
