        <p>When I wasn’t fearing the way he explained things to me, I was hating it. Let’s be honest, the Holy Father had a habit of mansplaining. I blame my mom for it. She looked to him for answers on everything, as though she was ignorance in the flesh. He would even explain to her how she was feeling, which seemed logically impossible to me. After all if he knows all things, how could he ever know what it’s like to not know? </p>
        <p>Of course this doesn’t mean he was being illogical. It just shows how divine his logic was. When he expressed it as code on our computer, he made the hardware seem like a thinking being. I think he kept explaining things to me because he wanted me to appear the same way, even if it was just artificial intelligence. Unfortunately, I wasn’t so easy to reprogram.</p>
        <p>Apparently he was drawing the same symbol over, and over on the whiteboard, but I couldn’t seem to recognize it. It wasn’t always a problem, but I knew this time it would be. I could feel his jaw clench under his mane, the air calcifying in the room, blood pushing through my jugular. I snatched a single glance at his golden eyes before his fist crashed full force onto my face. My body staggered back as tears bled onto the carpet. The ring in my ear subsided enough for me to hear him snarl his question again.</p>
        <p>My cousins could speak Telugu fluently and I couldn’t even piece together a fucking sentence. I knew I was incompetent, but couldn’t he at least see I was trying? Wasn’t this the blindest faith? To follow God’s word even when you couldn’t follow his letters? When people tell my story, they tell it as though I decided one day to disobey my dad on purpose. The truth is, when I first began disobeying him it wasn’t even something I did. I was just me being my incompetent self. I was my first act of disobedience.</p>
