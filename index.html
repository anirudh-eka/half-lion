        <p>Let’s be honest. The Holy Father had a habit of mansplaining. I blame my mom for it. She looked to him for answers on everything and to be fair, his knowledge was impossible.</p>          
        <p>Somehow he could know all things and, at the same time, know what it’s like to not know. That’s not a contradiction. That’s just how divine his logic was.</p> 
        <p>He used it when he wrote code to make our computer seem like a thinking being. I think he was teaching me again because he was hoping to make me display some intelligence too, even if it was just artificial.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately I just wasn’t recognizing the symbol he had drawn on the whiteboard. It wasn’t always a problem, but I knew this time it would be. I could feel his jaw clench under his mane, the air calcifying in the room, blood pushing through my jugular. I snatched a single glance at his golden eyes before his fist crashed full force onto my face. My body staggered back as tears bled onto the carpet. The ring in my ear subsided enough for me to hear him snarl his question again.</p>
        <p>My cousins could speak Telugu fluently and I couldn’t even piece together a fucking sentence. I knew I was incompetent, but couldn’t he at least see I was trying? Wasn’t this the blindest faith? To follow God’s word even when you couldn’t follow his letters?</p>
        <p>When people tell my story, they tell it as though I decided one day to disobey my dad on purpose. The truth is, when I first began disobeying him it wasn’t even something I did. I was just me being my incompetent self. I was my first act of disobedience.</p>
